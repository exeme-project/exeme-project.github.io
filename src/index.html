            <p>
                The Exeme Project was started when I was in secondary school, as a project under which to create my
                programming language. The project has since evolved outwards from that original vision, to
                many other applications, while still maintaining the original vision.

                <h3>the exeme language</h3>
                <p>
                    An optimised, elegant, and compiled programming language. Written in C,
                    it's designed to be fast and efficient (with a focus on high quality code), have a simple but
                    powerful syntax (with a focus on elegance), and to be portable (with a focus on cross-platform
                    support).
